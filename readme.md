Next TODOs
- Add test to rank sorting since it's out of sorts
- Can we share types between front and back end / is it worth doing so?
- Add clean name prioritization check
- Update only latest tournament / matches instead of full reload when tourneyCount is different
- (Optional) set CloudWatch retention to 2 weeks via tf
