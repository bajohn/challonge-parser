# Summit Tournament Tracker

Live web app:
https://summit-pool.com/

Below are mostly notes to self on next-ups.

## Next TODOs
- Make sure update works when tournaments are already logged in a pending state - they seem
- Support for doubles tournaments
- How to deal with repeated names via unique IDs
- H2H view
    - (In progress) Finish refactor of H2H storage
    - Build h2h view on front end, show player v player and past matches
- Add iTournament and iTournamentData types where missing (if anywhere)
- 
Nice to haves, probably won't do:
- When we're ready to create the clean base app - can we create a fresh version of this entire live app using a fork of the cleaned base app?

## Nice to haves
- Set CloudWatch retention to 2 weeks via tf
